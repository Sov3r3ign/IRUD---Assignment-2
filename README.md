# IRUD-Assignment-2
<h2>SECTION 1</h2> 
<h2>SCENARIO OVERVIEW</h2> 
It is vital to maintain a structured design and flexibility in code architecture to guarantee scalability and 
long-term ease of maintenance in the world of modern gaming, especially within role-playing games 
(RPGs). CastleForge, which is the system described in this assignment, simulates a fantasy battle 
scenario featuring character types such as knights and archers, each provided with unique abilities and 
customizable enhancements. The main objective is to effectively manage character actions, upgrades, 
and the overall game state, demonstrating solid software design principles through the application of 
design patterns. 
The CastleForge Battle System is built around three fundamental components:   
Game Management: This refers to the centralized supervision of game events through a singleton class 
known as GameManager, which ensures that all logs and interactions are controlled from a single access 
point.   
Character Actions: Actions that are done by characters, such as attacking, defending, and healing, are 
abstracted through a command structure that supports undoable actions.   
Character Enhancement: The enhancement of base characters like knights and archers is permitted by a 
decorator pattern. This enables them to be able to equip magical weapons and armour at runtime.   
To understand this system, one must understand the relationships and interactions between factories, 
commands, enhancements, and state management. The design encourages flexibility, allowing new 
character types or abilities to merge with the slightest adjustments. 

<h2>1.2.1 SINGLETON PATTERN</h2>
The singleton pattern is a design pattern that is used to ensure that a class can only have one concurrent 
instance. Whenever additional objects of a singleton class are required, the previously created, single 
instance is provided. 

<ul>
    <li>Class: GameManager </li>
    <li>Purpose: Ensures there is only one instance managing the battle logs and game state. </li>
    <li>Usage: All commands and system messages log to this centralized class. </li>
</ul>

<h2>1.2.2 COMMAND PATTERN</h2>
The command pattern is a design pattern that enables all of the information for a request to be contained 
within a single object. The command can then be invoked as required, often as part of a batch of queued 
commands with rollback capabilities. 
<ul>
    <li>Classes: AttackCommand, DefendCommand, HealCommand, BattleCommander </li>
    <li>Purpose: Encapsulates character actions into executable and undoable commands. </li>
    <li>Usage: Provides decoupling between the invoker (BattleCommander) and the receiver (Character).</li>
</ul> 

<h2>1.2.3 DECORATOR PATTERN</h2>
The decorator pattern is a design pattern that extends the functionality of individual objects by wrapping 
them with one or more decorator classes. These decorators can modify existing members and add new 
methods and properties at run-time. 
<ul>
    <li>Classes: CharacterDecorator, FlameSword, DragonSlayer, FlamingArrows.</li>
    <li>Purpose: Allows dynamic addition of enhancements (e.g., weapons, armor) to character objects.</li>
    <li>Usage: Promotes flexibility in character customization without modifying the base class.</li>
</ul>
